  I just rented this house in Medellín Colombia for 7-17 September.
  The first 5 people that give me money have a room reserved,
  you can do the whole thing for about a grand, money details are at the bottom.
  Here's a video of the house.

<p>Our hosts are wonderful, they threw me two birthday parties when I stayed with them!</p>

<p>We all got together and painted a mural on their wall! We decided it should only ever asymptotically approach finished, this way there is always a reason to invite people over for more painting ^^</p>

<p>It's a bus ride away from the Amazon rain forest and Guatape (pictured below).</p>

<p>There are some great tours through downtown Medellín!</p>

<p>The street art is amazing!</p>

<p>The neighbours like to come over for games</p>

<p>We could rent a place in the mountains</p>

<p>The humans are welcoming and wonderful!</p>

<hr />

<p>Our house has 6 rooms total, one is mine, so that leaves 5 spots open. Rooms are $250 each, for the whole 10 days ($25/night, half that if you bring a loved one). One room has its own bathroom, that one is $500 instead of $250, lets save it for whoever really cares about that sort of thing. The first 5 to get me $$ will have a spot reserved.</p>

<p>If your work pays for conferences, there is a <a href="http://www.rubyconf.co/">Ruby Conf</a> on Sept 8 and 9, tickets are $90, you might be able to get the whole thing paid for by your work!</p>

<p>Round trip plane tickets can be bought for under $500!</p>

<p><img src="images/flights2.png" alt="Plane tickets" /></p>

<p>So the whole thing can be done for &lt; $1000 (cost of living there is about a third what it is here).</p>

<p>The people are welcoming and wonderful, lets go to Medellín!</p>
