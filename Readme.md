Lets go to Colombia!
====================

Medellín Colombia is gorgeous! This photo is from a resturant in the mountains there.

I just rented this house in Medellín for 7-17 September. The whole thing can be done for < $1000 USD, details at the bottom.

Our hosts are wonderful, they threw me two birthday parties when I stayed with them!

We all got together and painted a mural on their wall! We decided it should only ever asymptotically approach finished, this way there is always a reason to invite people over for more painting ^^

It's a bus ride away from the Amazon rain forest and Guatape (pictured below).

There are some great tours where you can see downtown Colombia! (the red hoods are ponchos b/c it rained that day)

The street art is amazing!

This is how you dry your clothes:

The neighbours like to come over for games

We could rent a place in the mountains

The humans are welcoming and wonderful!

Our house has 6 rooms total, one is mine, so that leaves 5 spots open. Rooms are $250 each, for the whole 10 days ($25/night, half that if you bring a loved one). One room has its own bathroom, that one is $500 instead of $250, lets save it for whoever really cares about that sort of thing. The first 5 to get me $$ will have a spot reserved.

If your work pays for conferences, there is a [Ruby Conf](http://www.rubyconf.co/) on Sept 8 and 9, tickets are $90, you might be able to get the whole thing paid for by your work!

Round trip plane tickets can be bought for under $500!

So the whole thing can be done for < $1000 (cost of living there is about a third what it is here).
